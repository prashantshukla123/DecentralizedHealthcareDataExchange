# Decentralized Healthcare Data Exchange

## Project Description
The Decentralized Healthcare Data Exchange is a platform designed for secure and transparent healthcare data exchange. Patients have full control over their medical data, while healthcare providers can access it through smart contracts that manage permissions. All transactions and permissions are processed using Lumens (XLM) to ensure efficiency and transparency on the Stellar blockchain.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower patients by giving them complete ownership of their healthcare data, while enabling healthcare providers to access essential information in a secure and permissioned manner. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate the risks associated with centralized data storage, reduce inefficiencies in healthcare data sharing, and promote patient privacy and trust.

## Key Features
- **Patient-Controlled Data Access**: Patients are the sole custodians of their data and can grant or revoke access to healthcare providers as needed.
- **Smart Contract-Driven Permissions**: Access to patient data is managed by smart contracts, ensuring that only authorized healthcare providers can retrieve information.
- **Secure Data Exchange**: All data exchanges between patients and healthcare providers are encrypted and stored on the Stellar blockchain for immutability.
- **Transaction Management in Lumens (XLM)**: Payments and data access permissions are handled using Lumens (XLM), providing fast, secure, and low-cost transactions.
- **Transparency and Privacy**: The platform ensures that all transactions are transparent and verifiable while maintaining patient data confidentiality.
